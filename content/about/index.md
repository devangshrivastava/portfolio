<!-- In my daytime, I work as a Developer Advocate at a US Tech company. 

At night, I'm a content creator developing tutorials in data science for the following platforms:
- 📺 **YouTube**: [**Data Professor**](https://youtube.com/dataprofessor/), [**Coding Professor**](https://youtube.com/codingprofessor/)
- 📝 [**Medium Blogs**](https://data-professor.medium.com/).
- 💻 [**GitHub**](https://github.com/dataprofessor/)

In my previous role, I was an Associate Professor of Bioinformatics carrying out research in computational drug discovery:

Hi, I’m Devang—recently graduated from IIT Jodhpur with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I’m currently placed at Accenture Japan, where I’m preparing to start my professional journey. As part of this transition, I’m also learning Japanese to better integrate and communicate in both professional and cultural contexts.

I build systems that function reliably at scale—voice automation pipelines, collaborative platforms without central servers, and peer-to-peer networks that self-heal. My work includes integrating speech models with telephony, building cross-compilation toolchains for RISC-V, and developing LLM-powered entity resolution pipelines.

My interests extend to cryptography, theoretical computer science, and embedded systems. I enjoy working on projects where efficiency, architecture, and resilience come together. Outside of tech, I spend time with music, anime, and things that challenge the way I think.

And my thoughts on my [**portfolio**](https://devangshrivastava.github.io/portfolio/)

I just don't write blog about tech I write blog about me!
