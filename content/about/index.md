<!-- Hi, I‚Äôm Devang, a student at IIT Jodhpur with a deep passion for learning and building innovative technology. I am currently exploring the fields of blockchain and web3, and I thrive on curiosity, creativity, and tackling difficult challenges head-on.

Previously, I worked at a startup where I developed a cross-compiling toolchain using LLVM, converting code from x86 to RISC-V architecture. Currently, I am working as a cryptography assistant, helping a company build a secure chat application using the Signal Protocol. My role involves explaining the cryptography behind various protocols.

In addition to my work, I am conducting research in Graph Algorithms and aim to publish my findings by the end of this year.
