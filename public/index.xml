&lt;p&gt;To build a web app you‚Äôd typically use such Python web frameworks as Django and Flask. But the steep learning curve and the big time investment for implementing these apps present a major hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streamlit makes the app creation process as simple as writing Python scripts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, you‚Äôll learn how to master Streamlit when getting started with data science.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ERpred: a web server for the prediction of subtype-specific estrogen receptor antagonists</title>

&lt;p&gt;Estrogen receptors alpha and beta (ERŒ± and ERŒ≤) are responsible for breast cancer metastasis through their involvement of clinical outcomes. Estradiol and hormone replacement therapy targets both ERs, but this often leads to an increased risk of breast and endometrial cancers as well as thromboembolism. A major challenge is posed for the development of compounds possessing ER subtype specificity. Herein, we present a large-scale classification structure-activity relationship (CSAR) study of inhibitors from the ChEMBL database which consisted of an initial set of 11,618 compounds for ERŒ± and 7,810 compounds for ERŒ≤. The IC50 was selected as the bioactivity unit for further investigation and after the data curation process, this led to a final data set of 1,593 and 1,281 compounds for ERŒ± and ERŒ≤, respectively. We employed the random forest (RF) algorithm for model building and of the 12 fingerprint types, models built using the PubChem fingerprint was the most robust (Ac of 94.65% and 92.25% and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 89% and 76% for ERŒ± and ERŒ≤, respectively) and therefore selected for feature interpretation. Results indicated the importance of features pertaining to aromatic rings, nitrogen-containing functional groups and aliphatic hydrocarbons. Finally, the model was deployed as the publicly available web server called ERpred at &lt;a href=&#34;http://codes.bio/erpred&#34;&gt;http://codes.bio/erpred&lt;/a&gt; where users can submit SMILES notation as the input query for prediction of the bioactivity against ERŒ± and ERŒ≤.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Probing the origins of human acetylcholinesterase inhibition via QSAR modeling and molecular docking</title>

&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease which leads to the gradual loss of neuronal cells. Several hypotheses for AD exists (e.g., cholinergic, amyloid, tau hypotheses, etc.). As per the cholinergic hypothesis, the deficiency of choline is responsible for AD; therefore, the inhibition of AChE is a lucrative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine that is essential for cognition and memory. A large non-redundant data set of 2,570 compounds with reported IC50 values against AChE was obtained from ChEMBL and employed in quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study so as to gain insights on their origin of bioactivity. AChE inhibitors were described by a set of 12 fingerprint descriptors and predictive models were constructed from 100 different data splits using random forest. Generated models afforded R2, Q2CV and Q2Ext values in ranges of 0.66‚Äì0.93, 0.55‚Äì0.79 and 0.56‚Äì0.81 for the training set, 10-fold cross-validated set and external set, respectively. The best model built using the substructure count was selected according to the OECD guidelines and it afforded R2, Q2CV and Q2Ext values of 0.92 ¬± 0.01, 0.78 ¬± 0.06 and 0.78 ¬± 0.05, respectively. Furthermore, Y-scrambling was applied to evaluate the possibility of chance correlation of the predictive model. Subsequently, a thorough analysis of the substructure fingerprint count was conducted to provide informative insights on the inhibitory activity of AChE inhibitors. Moreover, Kennard‚ÄìStone sampling of the actives were applied to select 30 diverse compounds for further molecular docking studies in order to gain structural insights on the origin of AChE inhibition. Site-moiety mapping of compounds from the diversity set revealed three binding anchors encompassing both hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interaction. Molecular docking revealed that compounds 13, 5 and 28 exhibited the lowest binding energies of ‚àí12.2, ‚àí12.0 and ‚àí12.0 kcal/mol, respectively, against human AChE, which is modulated by hydrogen bonding, œÄ‚ÄìœÄ stacking and hydrophobic interaction inside the binding pocket. These information may be used as guidelines for the design of novel and robust AChE inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
